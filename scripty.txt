///////INTRO\\\\\\\
opens on F and D blowing stuff up
then during a particularly high jump derek crashes into a bird
its a convenient bird
derek then forgets all of his knowledge for the players sake
Felicia then asks derek how to walk to check for a concussion
he says to use wasd
felicia is worried bc you can also use arrow keys
then she points to a MOVING BLOCK and asks what it does
"it wont blow up, it just moves a little bit"
"and that one?" to a DESTRUCTABLE block
"it can blow up"
"okay.. tell me about the detonator types you have"
he does
but i dont remember them enough to explain them myself
"felicia, i really am okay, why do you seem so worried"
"well of course im worried about you. you just fell down really far.
*this in small font* and also i maybe heard about a story of someone gaining invincibilty after crashing into a goose"
"what?"
"what?
anyway were not done yet
how do you activate a lever?"
"press e"
"and a sensor?"
"it..senses you"
"can you explode a grate?"
"no. bombs go right through it. we can stand on them though"
"okay..lastly how do you throw and detonate a bomb"
"..."
"PLEASE tell me you know this"
"um..you.."
"you point and click to throw and press space to detonate!!
oh crap
oh no
oh we should have used more protective pads 
but nooo
i thought we'd be fine
who wouldve thought you would run into a BIRD
but of course
of course you ran into a bird"
"Felicia, felicia. i was kidding"
"...i dont think i believe you"
to prove it, derek throws a bomb into the nearby forest. and detonates it. some birds fly out of the trees. 
asnd then the CASTLE (supposedly just part of the background* falls down
f and d look at it
"how likely is it that no one will know it was us?" -derek
before f can answer ROCK TROLL rumbles on screen
"..."-felicia
"THAT WAS MY BEAUTIFUL BRAND NEW VACATION HOME
